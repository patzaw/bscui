Caveolae each comprise a caveolar bulb with a diameter of 60-80 nm, connected to an opening of fairly constant diameter. Caveolae might exists as single pits or can form a cluster of caveolae with non-caveolar membrane between the pits. In many tissues, and particularly in adipocytes, multiple caveolae are arranged around a central vacuolar domain. In developing muscle fibres, multiple caveolae are connected by a single neck to the cell membrane, producing large chains of interconnected caveolae. Another structural feature of caveolae in certain endothelia is the presence of a stomatal diaphragm, which consists of a central density and radial spikes, in the neck of the caveolae. Mature caveolae might be assembled in the Golgi apparatus. Caveolae can flatten out into the cell membrane, thereby loosing their caveolar identity." []

Depending on the organism, the CV complex (CVC) shows different degrees of specialization of its tubular and vesicular elements. In the most elaborate CVCs of certain ciliates, e.g. Paramecium, a central vacuole, the contractile vacuole or cisterna, is surrounded by radially oriented ampullae or radial arms. These ampullae are connected to a network of channels. Excess cytosolic water, acquired osmotically, is segregated by the radial arms and enters the vacuole, so that the vacuole swells (the fluid- filling phase). The vacuole then rounds (the rounding phase) and the radial arms sever from the vacuole. The vacuole membrane then fuses with the plasma membrane at the pore region and the pore opens. The vacuole shrinks as its fluid is discharged through the pore (the fluid-discharging phase). The pore closes when the fluid has been discharged. The radial arms then reattach to the vacuole, so that the vacuole swells again as the fluid enters from the arms (the next fluid-filling phase)." []

This alternative transport of pigment allows the animal to effect color changes important for camouflage and social interactions. Melanophores transport their pigment in response to extracellular cues: neurotransmitters in the case of fish and hormonal stimuli in the case of frogs. In both cases, melanosome dispersion is induced by elevation of intracellular cAMP levels, while aggregation is triggered by depression of cAMP. The regulatory mechanisms downstream of these second-messengers are poorly understood.

At the electronic-microscope level, they are composed of heterogeneous mixture of electro-dense particles with diameters ranging from 20-25 nm and are called interchromatin granules clusters (IGCs). Speckles are dynamic structures. Both their protein and RNA- protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations depending on the transcriptional state of the cell.

The paranodal loops tightly adhere to the axon through a continuous spiral of axo-glial junctions that resemble invertebrate septate junctions (SJs). The paranodal loops are a spiraled cytoplasmic channel that is contiguous with the perikaryon of the myelin forming cell and thus can serve as a conduit for transmitting axonally induced signals that could regulate glial gene transcription. These junctions also form a physical barrier that prevents diffusion of nodal sodium channels and juxtaparanodal potassium channels.

def: "The host is any organism in which another organism, or symbiont, spends part or all of its life cycle. Most animals and plants live symbiotically with microorganisms. The larger organism is called the host and smaller organism the symbiont. When the interactions between the symbiont and the host benefits both partners, the symbiotic interaction is called mutualism. When there is a negative effect on one of the partners, it is called a parasitic symbiosis and if there is no beneficial or negative effect it is a commensal symbiosis. These clear-cut definitions are not always easy to apply in nature. Take the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa for example. This bacterium can be found on the skin of humans and not cause disease, perhaps we would call it a commensial, but if the person has a severe burn P. aeruginosa can cause an infection and becomes a pathogen (a medicinal term for parasitism). This type of organism is called an opportunistic pathogen. Whether an association is a mutualist, commensal or parasitic depends on the relative \"strengths\" of the partners and the balance of power can change over time." []
