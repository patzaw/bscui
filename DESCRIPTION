Description: Render SVG as interactive figures to display contextual
   information, with selectable and clickable user interface elements.
   These figures can be seamlessly integrated into 'rmarkdown' and 'Quarto'
   documents, as well as 'shiny' applications, allowing manipulation of elements
   and reporting actions performed on them.
   Additional features include pan, zoom in/out functionality, and the ability
   to export the figures in SVG or PNG formats.
